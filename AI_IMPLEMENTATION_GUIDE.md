# AI-Powered Invoice Creation Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds AI-powered invoice creation to your jewelry shop management system. Users can now create invoices through natural language commands in the AI chat interface.

## Implementation Complete ✅

All components have been implemented according to the specification in `AI_Invoice.md`:

### 1. Database Layer
- ✅ `migrations/create_ai_actions_table.sql` - AI actions tracking table

### 2. Core Logic
- ✅ `lib/ai/actions/types.ts` - Base action types and interfaces
- ✅ `lib/ai/actions/invoice/invoice-action-schema.ts` - Zod validation schemas
- ✅ `lib/ai/actions/invoice/invoice-extractor.ts` - OpenAI function calling
- ✅ `lib/ai/actions/invoice/invoice-validator.ts` - Business logic validation
- ✅ `lib/ai/actions/invoice/invoice-executor.ts` - Invoice creation execution
- ✅ `lib/ai/prompts/system-prompts.ts` - AI system prompts

### 3. API Routes
- ✅ `app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` - Enhanced with action detection
- ✅ `app/api/ai/execute-action/route.ts` - Action execution endpoint

### 4. UI Components
- ✅ `components/ai-chat/action-confirmation-card.tsx` - Generic confirmation UI
- ✅ `components/ai-chat/invoice-preview-card.tsx` - Invoice preview
- ✅ `components/ai-chat/chat-message-item.tsx` - Updated to handle actions
- ✅ `lib/contexts/chat-context.tsx` - Updated to support action messages

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

Run the AI actions table migration in your Supabase database:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: migrations/create_ai_actions_table.sql
```

Or use the Supabase CLI:

```bash
supabase migration new create_ai_actions_table
# Copy the contents of migrations/create_ai_actions_table.sql to the new migration file
supabase db push
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env.local` file contains:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
```

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Invoice

User can type any of these commands in the AI chat:

**Example 1: Complete Information**
```
Create an invoice for Ram Kumar. He's buying 2 gold rings, each 10 grams at ₹5500 per gram
```

**Example 2: Multiple Items**
```
Make an invoice for Priya:
- 1 gold necklace, 25 grams, ₹6200/gram
- 2 gold bangles, 15 grams each, ₹5800/gram
Add her phone: 9876543210
```

**Example 3: With Customer Details**
```
Invoice for Rahul Kumar
Phone: +91 9876543210
Email: rahul@example.com
Address: 123 MG Road, Mumbai

Items:
- Gold Ring (22K), 12g, ₹5500/g, qty 1
- Silver Chain, 20g, ₹800/g, qty 1
```

### What Happens

1. **User sends message** → AI extracts intent and structured data
2. **Validation** → System validates prices, calculates totals
3. **Confirmation UI** → User sees preview with all details
4. **Execution** → On confirmation, invoice is created in database
5. **Navigation** → User is redirected to the new invoice page

## Features

### ✅ Implemented Features

1. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Extracts customer details from conversational text
   - Parses multiple items with quantities, weights, prices
   - Handles Indian business context (GST, rupees, grams)

2. **Validation**
   - Zod schema validation for data types
   - Business rule validation (price ranges)
   - Missing field detection with prompts

3. **Smart Totals Calculation**
   - Automatic item total calculation (qty × weight × price/gram)
   - Subtotal, GST (3% default), and grand total
   - Formatted in Indian rupee notation

4. **Customer Management**
   - Creates new customers automatically
   - Can reference existing customers (future enhancement)

5. **Audit Trail**
   - All AI actions logged in `ai_actions` table
   - Linked to chat sessions for full context
   - Success/failure tracking with error messages

6. **User Experience**
   - Real-time action confirmation cards
   - Invoice preview before creation
   - Validation warnings (non-blocking) and errors (blocking)
   - Loading states during execution
   - Automatic navigation to created invoice

## Architecture

### Flow Diagram

```
User Message
    ↓
Chat API (/api/ai/chat)
    ↓
Action Extractor (OpenAI Function Calling)
    ↓
Validator (Zod + Business Rules)
    ↓
Save to ai_actions table

User Clicks "Confirm"
    ↓
Execute Action API (/api/ai/execute-action)
    ↓
Invoice Executor
    ├→ Create/Find Customer
    ├→ Generate Invoice Number
    ├→ Create Invoice Record
    ├→ Create Invoice Items
    └→ Audit Log
    ↓
Navigate to Invoice Page
```

## Database Schema

### ai_actions Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE ai_actions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  session_id UUID NOT NULL,
  action_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  extracted_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  validation_errors JSONB DEFAULT '[]',
  missing_fields TEXT[] DEFAULT ARRAY[]::TEXT[],
  entity_id TEXT NULL,
  error_message TEXT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  executed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NULL
);
```

### Action Statuses

- `intent_detected` - AI identified the intent
- `extracting` - Extracting structured data
- `validating` - Validating extracted data
- `awaiting_confirmation` - Waiting for user to confirm
- `executing` - Creating in database
- `completed` - Successfully completed
- `failed` - Failed with error
- `cancelled` - User cancelled

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Database migration runs without errors
- [ ] AI chat loads and shows history
- [ ] Simple invoice creation: "Create invoice for John, 1 gold ring, 10g, ₹5500/g"
- [ ] Validation catches errors (e.g., missing customer name)
- [ ] Confirmation card shows correct totals
- [ ] Clicking "Confirm & Create" creates invoice
- [ ] User is redirected to invoice page
- [ ] Invoice data matches preview
- [ ] Audit log entry created in `ai_actions` table
- [ ] Error handling works (e.g., invalid data)

## Future Enhancements

As per the spec, this framework can be extended to:

1. **Customer Management**
   - "Add customer Rahul, phone 9876543210"
   - "Update Priya's email to priya@example.com"

2. **Inventory Management**
   - "Add 5 gold bangles, 15g each, SKU-GB-001"
   - "Mark item SKU-123 as sold"

3. **Stock Queries**
   - "Show me all gold items under 10 grams"
   - "What's my total gold inventory worth?"

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - "Create invoices for these 3 customers: [list]"
   - "Update prices for all 22K gold items to ₹6500/g"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Chat tables not found"
**Solution:** Run the database migrations in order:
1. `migrations/create_ai_chat_tables.sql`
2. `migrations/create_ai_actions_table.sql`

### Issue: "Unauthorized" error
**Solution:** Make sure user is logged in and token is valid

### Issue: "No invoice creation intent detected"
**Solution:** Use clearer language like "create invoice" or "make invoice"

### Issue: OpenAI API errors
**Solution:** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set and has credits

### Issue: Action confirmation doesn't show
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors, verify all components are imported

## Performance Considerations

- OpenAI API calls add ~1-2 seconds to response time
- Function calling is more reliable than text parsing
- Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per user (configurable)
- Caching: Consider caching user settings and customer lists

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User can only access their own actions
- Server-side validation before execution
- Audit trail for all operations
- No direct SQL injection risk (using Supabase client)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Review Supabase logs for backend errors
3. Check `ai_actions` table for failed actions
4. Verify OpenAI API key and credits

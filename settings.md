#### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Add a "Settings" Card to the Dashboard**
   - In the dashboard page, add a new `Card` component for "Settings" within the existing grid layout (assumed to be `grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`).
   - Style the card to match existing ones (e.g., `hover:border-primary/30 hover:shadow-md`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, and a button to navigate).
   - Add a `Link` to navigate to the new `/settings` route, with a button labeled "Go to Settings" (similar to "New Booking" in `app/bookings/page.tsx`).
   - Include an icon (e.g., `Settings` from `lucide-react`) for consistency with other cards.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `Button` from `components/ui/*`
     - `Link` from `next/link`
     - `Settings` icon from `lucide-react`

2. **Create a New Settings Page with Tabbed Layout**
   - Create a new page at `app/settings/page.tsx` to house the settings sections.
   - Follow the existing page structure: a `header` with logo and navigation (linking back to the dashboard), a `main` section with padding (`p-4 md:p-8`).
   - Use the `Tabs` component to create three tabs: "Firm Details," "Notifications," and "Backup."
   - Add a heading ("Settings") and description ("Manage your firm settings, notifications, and backups") above the tabs, similar to `app/bookings/page.tsx`.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx` (new file)
  
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` from `components/ui/tabs.tsx`
     - `Link` from `next/link`
     - `Button` from `components/ui/button.tsx`

3. **Implement the "Firm Details" Tab**
   - In the "Firm Details" tab, create a `Card` component with a `CardHeader` (title: "Firm Details", description: "Manage your firm's information").
   - Inside `CardContent`, add a form-like layout with `Label` and `Input` components for each field: "Firm Name," "Firm Address," "Firm Phone Number," "Firm GSTIN Number," "Firm Email Address," "Firm Website," and "Date of Establishment."
   - Make the `Input` components disabled for now (UI-only) and populate them with placeholder values (e.g., "Sethiya Gold" for Firm Name, "123 Jewelry Lane, Mumbai" for Firm Address, etc.).
   - Use a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-1 gap-4 md:grid-cols-2`) for responsiveness, as seen in `app/bookings/create/page.tsx`.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Label` from `components/ui/label.tsx`
     - `Input` from `components/ui/input.tsx`

4. **Implement the "Notifications" Tab**
   - In the "Notifications" tab, create a `Card` component with a `CardHeader` (title: "Notifications", description: "Configure your notification preferences").
   - Inside `CardContent`, add two subsections: "Notification Channels" and "Notification Frequency and Quiet Hours."
   - For "Notification Channels," use a `div` with `Checkbox` components for "Email Notifications," "Push Notifications," "SMS Notifications," and "WhatsApp Notifications" (disabled for now).
   - For "Notification Frequency and Quiet Hours," use a `div` with a `Select` component for "Notification Frequency" (placeholder options: "Instant," "Daily," "Weekly") and static text for "Quiet Hours" ("10:00 PM to 07:00 AM").
   - Use `space-y-4` for spacing between elements, as seen in other forms.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Checkbox` from `components/ui/checkbox.tsx`
     - `Select` from `components/ui/select.tsx`

5. **Implement the "Backup" Tab**
   - In the "Backup" tab, create a `Card` component with a `CardHeader` (title: "Backup & Restore", description: "Create backups and restore your data").
   - Inside `CardContent`, replicate the layout from the screenshot: two sections ("Create Backup" and "Restore Backup") side by side, and a "Backup History" section below.
   - For "Create Backup," add a `Button` labeled "Download Backup" (disabled for now) with a download icon (`Download` from `lucide-react`).
   - For "Restore Backup," add a file input field (labeled "Select Backup File," default value "No file chosen") and a warning message ("Restoring a backup will replace all your current data") in amber text, matching the screenshot.
   - For "Backup History," add two subsections ("Recent Backups Created" and "Recent Restores") with static text "No recent backups" and "No recent restores."
   - Use a grid layout (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6`) for the "Create Backup" and "Restore Backup" sections, as seen in `app/bookings/create/page.tsx`.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Button` from `components/ui/button.tsx`
     - `Input` from `components/ui/input.tsx` (for file input)
     - `Download` icon from `lucide-react`

6. **Ensure Consistent Styling and Accessibility**
   - Apply Tailwind CSS classes to match the app’s theme (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`) as defined in `styles/globals.css`.
   - Ensure accessibility by associating `Label` with `Input` components (e.g., using `htmlFor`) and providing ARIA attributes for disabled elements.
   - Use consistent spacing (`space-y-4`, `gap-4`) and responsive layouts (`md:grid-cols-2`) as seen in other pages.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
     - `styles/globals.css` (reused, no changes needed)
   - Functions/Classes:
     - None directly; relies on Tailwind CSS and UI components

#### Configuration or Database Migrations Required

- **Configuration**:
  - No changes to `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.mjs`, or `tsconfig.json` are required, as this is a UI-only change and the new page fits within the existing setup.

- **Database Migrations**:
  - None required, as this is a UI-only change and does not involve data storage or retrieval.

#### Notes on Architecture and Conventions

- The plan aligns with the codebase’s use of `Tabs` for sectioned layouts (e.g., `app/bookings/page.tsx`) and `Card` components for form-like sections (e.g., `app/bookings/create/page.tsx`).
- The UI follows the app’s existing patterns: a header with navigation, a main content area with padding, and a footer, as seen in `app/bookings/page.tsx`.
- Disabled inputs and buttons are used to indicate placeholder functionality, consistent with a UI-only implementation.
- Tailwind CSS classes and the `lucide-react` icon library are reused to maintain consistency with the app’s look and feel.
- The layout ensures responsiveness and accessibility, following patterns in the codebase (e.g., grid layouts, proper labeling).

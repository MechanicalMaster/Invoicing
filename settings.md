#### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Set Up the Settings Tabs Structure (if not already done)**  
   - Ensure the settings page (`app/settings/page.tsx`) uses a `Tabs` component (from `components/ui/tabs.tsx`) to display the tabs: "Account," "Firm Details," "Invoices," "Notifications," and "Backup." This matches the structure shown in the screenshot.
   - Add placeholder content for "Account" and "Invoices" tabs (e.g., a simple "Coming Soon" message) since they aren’t part of this change.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` components from `components/ui/tabs.tsx`

2. **Implement the Firm Details Section UI**  
   - In the "Firm Details" tab (`TabsContent` with `value="firm-details"`), create a `Card` component titled "Firm Details" to hold the form fields.
   - Add editable fields for "Firm Name," "Firm Address," "Firm Phone Number," "Firm GSTIN Number," "Firm Email Address," and "Firm Website" using the `Input` component (from `components/ui/input.tsx`).
   - Add a "Date of Establishment" field using the existing `DatePicker` component (from `app/bookings/create/date-picker.tsx`).
   - Use a grid layout (e.g., `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`) for responsiveness, consistent with other forms (e.g., `app/bookings/create/page.tsx`).
   - Apply consistent styling with Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `space-y-4` for spacing, `bg-background` for background) to match the app’s theme.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
     - Reuse `app/bookings/create/date-picker.tsx` (no changes needed)
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Input` from `components/ui/input.tsx`
     - `Label` from `components/ui/label.tsx`
     - `DatePicker` from `app/bookings/create/date-picker.tsx`

3. **Implement the Notifications Section UI**  
   - In the "Notifications" tab (`TabsContent` with `value="notifications"`), create a `Card` component titled "Notification Settings."
   - Add a subsection for "Notification Channels" with four toggle switches (Email, Push, SMS, WhatsApp) using the `Switch` component (from `components/ui/switch.tsx`).
   - Add a subsection for "Notification Frequency" with a dropdown (`Select` component from `components/ui/select.tsx`) containing placeholder options: "Instant," "Daily," "Weekly."
   - Add a subsection for "Quiet Hours" with two time inputs (HTML `type="time"`) for start (default: 10:00 PM) and end (default: 07:00 AM), wrapped in a `div` with a flex layout for alignment.
   - Use consistent styling (e.g., `space-y-4` for sections, `flex items-center gap-2` for toggle switches and labels).
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Switch` from `components/ui/switch.tsx`
     - `Select`, `SelectTrigger`, `SelectContent`, `SelectItem` from `components/ui/select.tsx`
     - `Label` from `components/ui/label.tsx`

4. **Verify the Backup Section UI**  
   - The "Backup" tab (`TabsContent` with `value="backup"`) already contains the "Backup & Restore" section as shown in the screenshot, with "Create Backup," "Restore Backup," and "Backup History."
   - Confirm that the existing UI matches the screenshot: a `Card` for "Create Backup," a `Card` for "Restore Backup," and a section for "Backup History."
   - Ensure the styling aligns with the app’s theme (e.g., Tailwind CSS classes like `bg-background`, `border-border`).
   - No changes are needed since the UI already exists, but verify consistency with the other sections.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx` (verify existing content)
   - Functions/Classes:
     - `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` from `components/ui/card.tsx`
     - `Button` from `components/ui/button.tsx`

5. **Ensure Consistent Styling Across All Sections**  
   - Apply Tailwind CSS classes to ensure all sections ("Firm Details," "Notifications," "Backup") have consistent spacing, colors, and typography, matching the app’s theme (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border` from `styles/globals.css`).
   - Use the `ThemeProvider` (from `components/theme-provider.tsx`) to ensure the selected theme (e.g., "slate") is applied correctly.
   - Verify accessibility by ensuring all inputs have associated `Label` components and proper ARIA attributes.
   - Impacted Files:
     - `app/settings/page.tsx`
     - `styles/globals.css` (reused, no changes needed)
   - Functions/Classes:
     - None directly; relies on Tailwind CSS and UI components

#### Configuration or Database Migrations Required

- **Configuration**:
  - No changes to `next.config.mjs`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.mjs`, or `tsconfig.json` are required, as this is a UI-only change.
  - The existing Tailwind CSS setup in `styles/globals.css` and `ThemeProvider` in `components/theme-provider.tsx` will handle theming.

- **Database Migrations**:
  - None required, as this is a UI-only change. Data persistence for "Firm Details" and "Notifications" settings would require backend changes, but that’s out of scope for now.

#### Notes on Architecture and Conventions

- The plan uses the existing `Tabs` component for navigation, consistent with the screenshot and the app’s pattern (e.g., `app/bookings/page.tsx` uses `Tabs` for filtering bookings).
- `Card` components are used for each section to maintain consistency with other forms (e.g., `app/bookings/create/page.tsx`).
- The `DatePicker` component is reused from `app/bookings/create/date-picker.tsx` to ensure a consistent date selection UI.
- Toggle switches (`Switch`) are used for notification channels, following the app’s pattern of using `Switch` for binary settings (seen in `components/ui/switch.tsx`).
- The `Select` component for "Notification Frequency" aligns with dropdown usage in the app (e.g., `components/ui/select.tsx`).
- Styling follows the Tailwind CSS conventions in `styles/globals.css`, ensuring consistency with the app’s theme and responsiveness (e.g., `grid` layouts for forms).
